# aws-terraform-module-ssm-session-manager
---

This project is part of our open source DevSecOps adoption approach. 

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

This module creates an SSM document that stores preferences for session manager.

Session preferences let you specify a location to store log output for all sessions in your AWS account. 
You can also enable server-side encryption using a AWS KMS key for a specified stream to ensure your session
records are transferred securely.

Requires `aws` provider >= 1.36.0

  s3_bucket_name = "session-logs-bucket"
  s3_key_prefix = "session-logs"
  s3_encryption_enabled = true
